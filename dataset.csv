"Sum of the areas of two squares is 640 m². If the difference of their perimeters is 64 m, find the sides of the two squares.",  
"1. Let the sides of the squares be `x` and `y` meters, where `x > y`.  
2. Given that the sum of their areas is 640 m²: x**2 + y**2 = 640.
3. Given that the difference of their perimeters is 64 m.
Final Equations: x**2 + y**2 = 640 and 4x - 4y = 64"

"Sum of the area of two squares is 400 cm². If the difference of their perimeters is 16 cm, find the sides of two squares.",  
"1. Let the sides of the squares be `x` and `y` cm, where `x > y`.  
2. Given that the sum of their areas is 400 cm²:  x**2 + y**2 = 400.
3. Given that the difference of their perimeters is 16 cm.
Final Equations: x**2 + y**2 = 400 and 4x - 4y = 16".

"A takes 10 days less than the time taken by B to finish a piece of work. If both A and B together can finish the work in 12 days, find the time taken by B to finish the work.",  
"1. Let B take `x` days to finish the work alone.  
2. Since A takes 10 days less, A will take `(x - 10)` days.  
3. Work done by A in one day is `1 / (x - 10)`, and by B in one day is `1 / x`.  
4. Together, they complete the work in 12 days.
Final Equation: (1 / (x - 10)) + (1 / x) = 1 / 12"

"If two pipes function simultaneously, a reservoir will be filled in 12 hours. One pipe fills the reservoir 10 hours faster than the other. How many hours will the second pipe take to fill the reservoir?",  
"1. Let the time taken by the slower pipe to fill the reservoir alone be `x` hours.  
2. Then, the faster pipe takes `(x - 10)` hours.  
3. Work done by the slower pipe in one hour is `1 / x`, and by the faster pipe is `1 / (x - 10)`.  
4. Together, they fill the reservoir in 12 hours.
Final Equation: (1 / x) + (1 / (x - 10)) = 1 / 12"

"To fill a swimming pool, two pipes are used. If the pipe of larger diameter is used for 4 hours and the pipe of smaller diameter for 9 hours, only half of the pool can be filled. Find how long it would take for each pipe to fill the pool separately, if the pipe of smaller diameter takes 10 hours more than the pipe of larger diameter to fill the pool.",  
"1. Let the larger pipe take `x` hours to fill the pool alone.  
2. The smaller pipe takes `x + 10` hours.  
3. Work done by the larger pipe in one hour is `1 / x`, and by the smaller pipe is `1 / (x + 10)`.  
4. Given that using the larger pipe for 4 hours and the smaller pipe for 9 hours fills half the pool:  
Final Equation: (4 / x) + (9 / (x + 10)) = 1 / 2"
