      <td><br>        1. Let x be the number of apples with P and y be the number of apples with Q.<br>        2. If B gives A 10 apples, then A has x + 10 and B has y - 10.<br>        3. According to A's statement, x + 10 = 2(y - 10).<br>        4. If A gives B 10 apples, then A has x - 10 and B has y + 10.<br>        5. According to B's statement, x - 10 = y + 10.<br>        Final Equations: <br>        x + 10 = 2(y - 10) and x - 10 = y + 10<br></td>

      <td>On selling a T.V. at 5% gain and a fridge at 10% gain, Reliance Digital gains Rs 2000. But if it sells the T.V. at 10% gain and the fridge at 5% loss, he gains Rs 1500 on the transaction. Find the actual prices of T.V. and fridge.</td>
      <td><br>        1. Let x be the cost price of the T.V. and y be the cost price of the fridge.<br>        2. Selling the T.V. at 5% gain gives 0.05x, and selling the fridge at 10% gain gives 0.10y.<br>        3. The total gain from selling at these rates is 0.05x + 0.10y = 2000.<br>        4. In the second scenario, the gain from selling the T.V. at 10% is 0.10x, and the loss from the fridge at 5% loss is -0.05y.<br>        5. The total gain in this case is 0.10x - 0.05y = 1500.<br>        Final Equations: <br>        0.05x + 0.10y = 2000 and 0.10x - 0.05y = 1500<br></td>

      <td><br>        1. Let x be the age of A and y be the age of B.<br>        2. The difference in their ages gives x - y = 2.<br>        3. Since D is twice as old as A, we have D = 2x.<br>        4. If B is twice as old as his sister C, we express C's age as C = y / 2.<br>        5. The age difference between D and C gives 2x - (y / 2) = 40.<br>        Final Equations: <br>        x - y = 2 and 2x - (y / 2) = 40<br></td>

Setting up the equation from the first condition, x + 5 = 3(y + 5).<br>        4. Five years ago, the father's age was x - 5 and the son's age was y - 5.<br>        5. From this condition, we have x - 5 = 7(y - 5).<br>        Final Equations: <br>        x + 5 = 3(y + 5) and x - 5 = 7(y - 5)<br></td>

Dharam's age is 2x, and Ranjit's sister's age is C = y / 2.<br>        4. The difference in ages between Dharam and Jaspreet gives 2x - (y / 2) = 30.<br>        Final Equations: <br>        x - y = 3 and 2x - (y / 2) = 30<br></td>
